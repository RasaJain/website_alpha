BujjiOS

An open-source, minimal Android-based cluster interface for motorcycles and bicycles.

Inspired by simplicity. Designed by need. Driven by love.

What is BujjiOS?

BujjiOS is a lightweight, open-source Android interface that turns your smartphone into a functional, customizable bike cluster. Just mount your phone, plug in a USB (OTG), and you're set. Monitor essential info—speed, fuel, indicators, battery—and optionally launch split-screen for navigation or music.
No bloat. No distractions. Just the ride.

Why Bujji?

The name is inspired by Bujji, the intelligent machine from Kalki 2898 AD. This project pays respectful homage—while building something practical, modular, and deeply rooted in Indian jugadu spirit.
